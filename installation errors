Two questions for installation of Tensorflow package:
1.The existing versions of Tensorflow are only supported by 64-bit system and python in Windows.
2.pip.py should be ungraded to higher versions by     python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip    command.

Notes:delete venv folds with old configuration info
